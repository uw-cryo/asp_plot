# asp_plot
Scripts and notebooks to visualize output from the [NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP)](https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline).

## Motivation
Our objective is to release a set of standalone Python scripts that can be run automatically on an ASP output directory to prepare a set of standard diagnostic plots, publication-quality output figures, and a pdf report with relevant information, similar to the reports prepared by many commercial SfM software packages (e.g., Agisoft Metashape, Pix4DMapper).

## Status
This is a work in progress, with initial notebooks compiled from recent projects using sample stereo images from the Maxar WorldView, Planet SkySat-C and BlackSky Global constellations. We plan to refine these tools in the coming year, and we welcome community contributions and input.
