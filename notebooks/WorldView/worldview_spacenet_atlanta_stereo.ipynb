    "## WorldView Stereopair Processing: SpaceNet Atlanta Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a stereo processing workflow for WorldView satellite imagery using the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP).\n",
    "\n",
    "The example uses publicly available WorldView-2 data from the [SpaceNet Atlanta dataset](https://spacenet.ai/off-nadir-building-detection/), which provides multi-view imagery at various off-nadir angles over Atlanta, Georgia.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers a basic stereo workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Retrieval** - Download WorldView imagery from AWS S3\n",
    "- **Mosaicking Tiles** - Not used here, but how to tile image for full processing later\n",
    "- **CCD Artifact Correction** - Apply `wv_correct` to fix sensor artifacts\n",
    "- **Reference DEM Preparation** - Obtain and prepare Copernicus 30m DEM\n",
    "- **Bundle Adjustment** - Camera model refinement\n",
    "- **Define Region of Interest** - Select a region of interest for processing\n",
    "- **Mapprojection** - Project cropped images onto reference DEM\n",
    "- **Stereo Processing** - Generate DEM from stereopair\n",
    "- **Visualization with `asp_plot`** - Analyze results and compare with ICESat-2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The full SpaceNet images are very large (~35,000 x 55,000 pixels each). To make processing manageable, we will process individual tiles and crop to a smaller region of interest.\n",

    "### SpaceNet Atlanta Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [SpaceNet Off-Nadir Building Detection Challenge](https://spacenet.ai/off-nadir-building-detection/) provides WorldView-2 imagery collected over Atlanta, Georgia at multiple viewing angles. This dataset is ideal for demonstrating stereo processing because it includes imagery from various off-nadir angles that can form stereopairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is hosted on AWS S3 and can be accessed directly via HTTPS without authentication. Available scenes are organized by nadir angle and catalog ID (CATID):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://spacenet-dataset/AOIs/AOI_6_Atlanta/\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nadirX_catid_YYYY/` directories contain mapprojected orthoimages, which we **cannot use for stereo processing**. Instead, after exploring the available data, we will need to gather the **raw L1B images from the `metadata/` directory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting a Stereopair\n",
    "\n",
    "For stereo processing, we want two images with:\n",
    "- Sufficient baseline (convergence angle ~15-45 degrees)\n",
    "- Good overlap\n",
    "- Similar illumination conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we select:\n",
    "- `nadir7_catid_1030010003D22F00` (near-nadir, ~7 degrees off-nadir)\n",
    "- `nadir30_catid_10300100036D5200` (off-nadir, ~30 degrees off-nadir)\n",
    "\n",
    "This pairing provides a convergence angle of approximately 23 degrees, suitable for stereo reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a working directory and download the files with `aws`, ensuring you are gathering the un-processed L1B files from the `metadata/` subdirectory:\n",
